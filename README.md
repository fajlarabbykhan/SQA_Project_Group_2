# Documentation for Selenium WebDriver 
Selenium is a popular framework for automating web browsers, allowing developers and testers to simulate user interactions with web applications. To utilize Selenium effectively, We need to Download & install Java (https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows), Download & configure Intellij IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or any Java IDE and  Download the Selenium clients and WebDriver language bindings (https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

* Download & install Java in pc. (**Visit the Oracle JDK Download Page**) - Go to the official Oracle JDK download page at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html (or the latest version URL). Be sure to review and accept the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE before downloading. (**Select the Version**) Choose the version of Java Development Kit (JDK) that you want to download. It's recommended to choose the latest version for the most up-to-date features and security patches. (**Choose the Operating System**)  Select your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the available options.(**Download the Installer**) Click on the download link for your operating system. This will initiate the download of the JDK installer file. (**Run the Installer**) Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and run it by double-clicking on it. (**Follow the Installation Wizardr**) The installer will guide you through the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up Java on your computer. You might need to specify the installation directory and agree to the terms and conditions.(**Set the PATH Environment Variable For Windows**) This step is optional but recommended. To use Java from the command line, you can set the PATH environment variable to point to the Java installation directory. This allows you to run Java commands without specifying the full path. (**Verify the Installation**) After the installation is complete, open a command prompt (or terminal) and type java -version. This should display the version of Java you just installed.
